## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1 - SEC-001: Input validation with Zod schemas
**Status:** Completed
**Task:** Implement input validation with Zod schemas across all API routes

**Changes:**
- Created `src/lib/validations/` with comprehensive Zod schemas:
  - `index.ts` - validateRequest helper, common schemas
  - `generate.ts` - image/video/copy generation schemas
  - `projects.ts` - project CRUD schemas
  - `auth.ts` - signup/login/password schemas
  - `user.ts` - profile/settings schemas
- Updated API routes to use validation:
  - `/api/generate/image` - uses generateImageSchema
  - `/api/generate/video` - uses generateVideoSchema
  - `/api/generate/copy` - uses generateCopySchema
  - `/api/projects` - uses createProjectSchema, paginationSchema

**Decisions:**
- Used Zod v4 API (issues vs errors)
- Created validateRequest helper for consistent error responses
- Added sensible defaults and limits (max 10 images, max 5 videos)

**Also fixed:**
- Added typecheck script to package.json
- Added .eslintrc.json config
- Fixed TypeScript errors in credits.ts (added BRAND_EXTRACTION type)
- Fixed JSON type casting in copy/route.ts and extract-brand/route.ts
- Fixed iterator in brand-extraction.ts
- Installed zod, eslint@8, eslint-config-next@14.2.0

### Iteration 2 - SEC-002: Rate limiting for API endpoints
**Status:** Completed
**Task:** Add rate limiting to all API endpoints

**Changes:**
- Created `src/lib/rate-limit/index.ts` with token bucket rate limiter:
  - In-memory store with automatic cleanup
  - Predefined limits: GENERATION (10/min), WRITE (30/min), READ (100/min), AUTH (5/min)
  - Rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
  - 429 response with Retry-After header
- Updated API routes with rate limiting:
  - `/api/generate/image` - GENERATION limit
  - `/api/generate/video` - GENERATION limit
  - `/api/generate/copy` - GENERATION limit
  - `/api/projects` GET - READ limit
  - `/api/projects` POST - WRITE limit

**Decisions:**
- Used in-memory token bucket (can upgrade to Redis later)
- Rate limit by user ID for authenticated requests, IP for anonymous
- Conservative limits for generation (expensive), relaxed for reads

---

### Iteration 3 - GEN-001: Credit check before generation
**Status:** Already implemented (verified existing)
**Notes:** All generation routes already check balance with checkCreditBalance and deduct credits before API calls, returning 402 on insufficient balance.

---

### Iteration 4 - GEN-003: Better error handling
**Status:** Completed
**Task:** Better error handling and user feedback for generation failures

**Changes:**
- Created `src/lib/errors.ts` with standardized error handling:
  - ErrorCode enum with all error types
  - User-friendly error messages for each code
  - AppError class for throwing typed errors
  - createErrorResponse helper for consistent API responses
  - handleError for catching unexpected errors
  - Errors object with specific creators (unauthorized, notFound, etc.)
- Updated generation routes to use new error handling:
  - `/api/generate/image` - uses Errors.* helpers
  - `/api/generate/video` - uses Errors.* helpers
  - `/api/generate/copy` - uses Errors.* helpers

**Decisions:**
- Consistent error response format with code, message, details, timestamp
- HTTP status codes mapped to error types
- Dev mode exposes error details, prod hides them

---

### Iteration 5 - INFRA-001: CI/CD pipeline
**Status:** Completed
**Task:** Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

**Changes:**
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
  - lint-and-typecheck job: runs typecheck and lint
  - build job: installs deps, generates Prisma client, builds app
  - Triggered on push/PR to main and Development branches
  - Uses Node.js 22, npm caching for speed
  - Test job commented out (ready when tests added)

**Notes:**
- Vercel handles automatic deployments via GitHub integration
- CI pipeline validates code quality before merge
- Uses --legacy-peer-deps for npm due to version conflicts

---

### Iteration 6 - GEN-002: Retry logic for failed generation requests
**Status:** Completed
**Task:** Implement retry logic for failed generation requests

**Changes:**
- Created `src/lib/retry.ts` with comprehensive retry utilities:
  - `withRetry` - Main retry function returning result object with metadata
  - `retryAsync` - Simplified wrapper that throws on final failure
  - `createRetryWrapper` - Factory for creating reusable retry configurations
  - Exponential backoff with configurable multiplier (default 2x)
  - Optional jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Configurable `isRetryable` function for custom retry logic
  - `onRetry` callback for logging/monitoring
  - Default detection of retryable errors (5xx, timeouts, network errors)

- Updated generation routes to use retry logic:
  - `/api/generate/image` - 3 retries, 2s initial delay, 30s max
  - `/api/generate/video` - 3 retries, 3s initial delay, 60s max (videos take longer)
  - `/api/generate/copy` - 3 retries, 1s initial delay, 15s max (OpenAI is fast)

**Decisions:**
- Created standalone retry module rather than extending utils.ts (better separation)
- Different delay configurations per generation type based on API characteristics
- Default retry on 408, 429, 500-504 status codes and common network errors
- Jitter enabled by default to prevent synchronized retries across users
- Logging on each retry attempt for debugging

**Files changed:**
- `src/lib/retry.ts` (new)
- `src/app/api/generate/image/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/generate/video/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/generate/copy/route.ts`

### Iteration 7 - LEGAL-001: Terms of Service page
**Status:** Completed
**Task:** Create Terms of Service page

### Iteration 8 - LEGAL-002: Privacy Policy page
